The hardwood floors you see here are completely original, and they’ve been carefully preserved over the years. The same goes for the architecture- those high ceilings and detailed mouldings are a testament to the craftsmanship of that era. However, the furniture you see isn’t original. It was replaced a few years ago to give the home a more modern, functional feel. But don’t worry, the updates blend well with the classic features, giving you the best of both words- historic charm with modern comfort."

One option is to ask for a transfer to another branch within the same company. This can offer the same benefits as getting a new job, without the challenges of starting over somewhere new."

The city got its name because of all the big rocks you can see around us. Over time, people built houses and roads between these rocks. Today, we can still see many old buildings from long ago."

These things can make the air dirty, but in the countryside, there’s a bigger issue. Farmers often start fires to clean their fields. They burn old plants and grass.
