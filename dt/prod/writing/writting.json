This sudden change is quite concerning, and many students, including myself, are finding it difficult to adjust our study plans in such a short time. I believe the college should have given more notice to avoid causing unnecessary stress for students. It might be helpful to offer additional support, such as extra study sessions or extending the revision period.

Although it’s unfortunate, I believe we can manage by following the usual routines and helping each other out. It might be a good opportunity for us to learn more independently and improve our skills.\nHowever, if any members feel uncertain, I suggest we organize a few group sessions where we can support each other. Additionally, it might be helpful to have a guideline available for everyone during this period.\nI hope everything goes well, and I look forward to seeing everyone continue their training.\nBest regards,\nJimmy"

Another idea could be offering a membership system where paying members could get discounts or exclusive access.

I suggest providing a travel guide with common phrases in different languages to help with communication. Also, recommending useful apps like Google Translate and local language learning apps could ease the process.\nAdditionally, organizing workshops or online resources to familiarize members with cultural norms and etiquette in different countries would be valuable. It’s important to prepare travelers for common situations they might encounter abroad.\nI am happy to assist in gathering resources or organizing these initiatives. I believe these efforts will make international travel a smoother experience for first-time travelers.\nBest regards,\nJimmy"
